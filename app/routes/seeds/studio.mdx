### What is a Studio?

A studio is an intentional place to practice a way of being through play.

### What is a Studio to me?

Yet this does not quite answer what a studio is _to me_

For that I feel I have to introspect a little. And it's not trying to be a studio
in the broad sense. It's what I want a studio to be for me.

In the shower I thought, the place should be the gateway drug to making.

The intention and practice would be then, to make making, approachable and accessible to everyone.
To start their journey into making. Reveal the magic behind things.

Approachable and accessible. Can make serious things and goofy things. Art.

A place to find balance between the physical and the digital.
A place to free self from perfection.
A place to build and learn together.
A place to experiment and play in many modalities.
A place where ideas are welcome and brought to life with help from others.
A place where people gather to help the community around them.

For me this doesn't really feel that concrete, but really I
just want to invite people in to my house to _make things_.
Maybe it's sewing. Maybe it's building something with microelectronics.
Maybe it's woodworking.

These are all things I love to play with and just want to help
other people play with them too. Give the opportunity to more people
to learn and do things yourself and learn how they work. Seeing how
people come together and help eachother is a wonderful thing.

At my recent "sewing party" I taught friends how to sew, but there is only
one of me. A magical thing happened however, I taught one person one thing
and moved on to teach another person something else. While I was doing that
someone asked the first person I taught how to do a thing, and they
taught it. So quickly learning is transfered and solidified through
the teaching process.
