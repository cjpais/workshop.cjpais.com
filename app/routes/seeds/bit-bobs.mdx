A section or something dedicated to 'bits and bobs'

things that are like explicitly not full projects.

but are like fun and maybe interesting

Things that like really don't take me a lot of time to think about or post and are a bit more than a seed. They've like kinda grown from a seed to something that exists in a way, more than just a pondering of a sort.
