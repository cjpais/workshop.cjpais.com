title: "'blob' blogging"
---

Okay, this one is more like, I just want to drop a bunch of audio notes into a directory 
and be able to refine and build a blog post or something like that from them. And actually, 
it doesn't have to be just those audio notes, it could be videos or related projects, links, 
whatever, just like a giant blob of hyper media objects that I can go and refine into something more meaningful.
