title: knowledge isnt private
---

its meant for sharing

this is probably broader in ip and stuff but its quite the complex topic to model

i have a lot of opinions around open source as well as having worked at a company who made a lot of money off ip

both have a place i guess, but i just prefer to share knowledge overall. is it overall better? who knows
