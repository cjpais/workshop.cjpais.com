Hey, I'm CJ and welcome to my workshop! My workshop is a place I like to play around 
with technology I find interesting and share it with you. A place dedicated to learning
in public, and hopefully some teaching as well, and to show how possible, fun, and easy
it can be to build technology that benefits you and the community around you.

I'm a curious software engineer, I worked at Qualcomm on 5G L1 SW for a couple years before I 
quit and decided to play around with the things I love the most full time. I've met some incredible
people along the way and have been extremely lucky to have been able to make it work for the past
4 years and counting. I love open source software and try to contribute to it as much as I can.

Balance between the natural and digital worlds are very important to me. I love spending
time outside and playing in the real world where I can, just as much as I love playing with
technology. You'll probably find me surfing, climbing, slacklining, juggling, biking, running, 
swimming, diving, flying, hiking, or anything really. If you want you can check out what's 
in my [burrito](https://cj.burrito.place).
