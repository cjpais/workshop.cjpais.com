Hey, I'm CJ and welcome to my workshop! My workshop is a place where I play around 
with technology and share it with you! It's my place dedicated to learning
in public, and hopefully some teaching as well. I wish to show how possible, fun, and easy
it can be to build technology that benefits you and the community around you.

My earliest memory is upgrading the RAM in my dad's Pentium III workstation from 512MB to 768MB, which sparked a lifelong curiosity about computers and technology. 
After spending two years at Qualcomm working on 5G L1 software, I left to pursue my curiosity full-time.
I've been so lucky to meet incredible people along the way and be able to make it work for the past 4 years and counting.
I'm passionate about open source software and contribute whenever possible. 
I hope to inspire in you the same curiosity, passion, and childlike wonder that I experience when working with technology.

Balance between the natural and digital worlds are very important to me. I love spending
time outside and playing in the real world where I can. You'll probably find me surfing, 
climbing, slacklining/highlining, juggling, biking, running, 
swimming, diving, flying, hiking, or anything really.
