Hey, I'm CJ and welcome to my workshop! My workshop is a place where I play around 
with technology and share it with you! It's my place dedicated to learning
in public, and hopefully some teaching as well. I wish to show how possible, fun, and easy
it can be to build technology that benefits you and the community around you.

The first thing I can remember is upgrading the RAM in a Pentium III workstation my dad had from 512MB to 768MB.
I've been curious about computers and technology ever since. In more recent times, I worked 
at Qualcomm on 5G L1 SW for 2 years before I quit and decided to play around with technology full time. 
I've met some incredible people along the way and have been extremely lucky to have been able to make it work for the past
4 years and counting. I love open source software and try to contribute to it as much as I can.
I hope to evoke in you the same curiosity, passion, and childlike wonder that I feel when I'm
working with technology.

Balance between the natural and digital worlds are very important to me. I love spending
time outside and playing in the real world where I can, just as much as I love playing with
technology. You'll probably find me surfing, climbing, slacklining/highlining, juggling, biking, running, 
swimming, diving, flying, hiking, or anything really.
