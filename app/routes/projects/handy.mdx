I started out with [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper)
which was an excellent and quick way to get going. But quickly I found
it lacked some things that I sorely needed for using a computer with 
one hand and my voice. 

I wanted to add two things, both which involve LLM's rewriting whatever
I had highlighted. The first was specific to code, so I could have Claude
rewrite whatever I had highlighted based on what I say. I wanted this in 
any text field as well. I didn't know of any apps doing this at the time,
nor was I going to take time to search for one.

I already had a ton of experience running speech to text locally (specifically Whisper). 
I wrote the initial version of [Whisperfile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile/tree/main/whisper.cpp).
It runs Whisper on the [andromeda.computer](https://andromeda.computer) powering [Geppetto](https://geppetto.app).

Fortunately I have a ton of experience
with Whisper through writing Whisperfile, as well as running it on 
the [andromeda.computer](https://andromeda.computer) network
which powers [Geppetto](https://geppetto.app).
