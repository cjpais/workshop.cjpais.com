Footy is a DIY foot pedal for your computer. Pair it with a speech-to-text app
and suddenly you've got weird, fun, and unique way to compute using your feet. 
It's like having an extra set of handsâ€”except, you know, they're actually your feet!

I made Footy while I had a broken finger and my right hand was in a cast.
I certainly consider Footy to be an accessibility device, but I think it
can really be used by anyone who wants to use their computer differently.
There's something hilarious yet satisfying about using your computer with your feet.
I'm excited to show you how to build your own Footy so you can stick your 
foot in your mouth too. Oh wait, maybe remove the foot from your mouth.
Don't be shy, let's get into it

## Background

I broke my finger on January 2nd and was put into a cast soon after they 'realigned' my finger.
As soon as I had broken my finger, I was using speech or text all of the time on my Mac.
But it was quite uncomfortable/painful to use with a broken finger so I started thinking about ways in which I could trigger
speech to text without needing my hand or fingers.
A foot pedal became immediately obvious as a solution.

I checked Amazon for computer foot pedals, but found only 
USB-A options (unacceptable). With this I decided to make my own, and
Footy was born.

## Requirements

With some background in mechanical keyboards and their firmware, I figured 
the most straightforward approach would be to build what's essentially a 
one-key keyboard for your foot. My requirements quickly shaped up to be:

* USB-C Connector
* QMK Firmware
* Some RP2040 based microcontroller
* 3D Printed Case
* Cherry MX Switch
* Open Source Hardware/Software 
* Replicable for others

***MOST OF ALL IT HAS TO BE FUN***

## Prototype

I needed to decide on two key components: the microcontroller and the case. 
After a little bit of looking around I decided on the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040
for the microcontroller as it was cheap, tiny, and had a built in USB-C connector. For the
case I browsed around for quite a while, and eventually found this 
<ExternalLink href="https://learn.adafruit.com/USB-foot-switch-circuit-python" target="_blank">Adafruit project</ExternalLink>
for a foot pedal which I used as the foundation for my design.

After some minor hacking on the case and initial QMK firmware, I had a working prototype.
Here's what it looked like before I accidentally destroyed it by using CA glue:

## V1

While the prototype worked, it was janky and too handwired for my taste.
I wanted something a bit easier for someone else to make if they wanted.
Basically, all I wanted was a Cherry MX switch to be on the same PCB as the RP2040 microcontroller.
I thought a little about making a custom PCB, but discovered
the <ExternalLink href="https://keeb.io/products/stampy-rp2040-usb-c-controller-board-for-handwiring">Stampy microcontroller</ExternalLink>
which seemed very well suited to this project. Plus, its name was just perfect. 
I was going to be putting a Stampy into my Footy and I would be stamping on my Footy.

### 3D Printable Case

I modified the Adafruit foot pedal design for the Stampy. I adding heat set inserts to the base 
for secure mounting, and a larger rectangle on top for better switch actuation. 
All customizations were done in Autodesk Fusion, and you can find both `.stl` 
files for printing and `.f3d` files for modification on 
<ExternalLink href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1185240-footy">Makerworld</ExternalLink>.

### QMK + VIA Firmware

I wrote QMK firmware for Footy along with a VIA profile to make it easily customizable.
QMK is firmware for keyboards, and VIA makes it easy to change keymaps and other things.
The firmware primarily targets the center switch on the Stampy.

The main thing for it was to get my key binding for handy or superwhisper to be the default.

I have an <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/25151">open PR</ExternalLink> 
in the QMK repo for the Footy firmware. Once merged, I'll submit a PR to VIA so Footy gets official support there as well.

## Build Guide

Building your own Footy is easy

### Steps

1. Download and 3D print the case (or [email me](mailto:cj@cjpais.com), I can print you one)
2. Download and flash the firmware on the Stampy
3. Put the Stampy in the Footy
4. Plug it in and start computing with your feet!

### Materials Needed

* (1x) <ExternalLink href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1185240-footy">Footy Case</ExternalLink>
* (1x) <ExternalLink href="https://keeb.io/products/stampy-rp2040-usb-c-controller-board-for-handwiring">Stampy Microcontroller</ExternalLink>
* (1x) Cherry MX Switch (ideally with 3 and not 5 legs)
* *optional: (2x) M3x4mm - Heat Set Inserts*
* *optional: (2x) M3x6mm - Screws*

### Flashing the Firmware

You can find the QMK/VIA enabled firmware here:

* <ExternalLink href="https://blob.cjpais.com/footy/footy_default.uf2">Footy Default Keymap</ExternalLink> (triggers the `b` key)
* <ExternalLink href="https://blob.cjpais.com/footy/footy_handy.uf2">Footy Handy Keymap</ExternalLink> (triggers `RCTL + RGUI` while held down)
* <ExternalLink href="https://blob.cjpais.com/footy/footy_superwhisper.uf2">Footy Superwhisper Keymap</ExternalLink> (triggers `LOPT + SPACE` while held down)
* <ExternalLink href="https://blob.cjpais.com/footy/via.json">via.json</ExternalLink>

You can flash the firmware on the Stampy by plugging it into your computer and double clicking the button on it. 
This will load the Stampy into it's bootloader. From here, drag and drop the `.uf2` file of your 
choosing onto the drive that appears on your computer's file explorer. The Stampy will reboot, and it should turn into a working Footy.

## Using Footy

It's funny how you become accustomed to a thing without even realizing it. And of course you notice when it's gone the most.
Most of the time this is when I'm on the couch and not at my desk. And all of a sudden I want to speak to my computer, but don't have my Footy to do so.

It's interesting because I also have speech to text buttons on my desk, yet Footy is my go-to.
I think maybe it's because when I have my hands on a keyboard, I naturally want to type. But my feet have no such inclination.

Footy gets a lot of use for me when I'm at my desk programming, emailing, sending messages, or
talking to large language models for help in all of these things.

I wrote most of this post using my voice. I love using my voice for something like this.
There are times at which the syntactic preciseness of typing is important, but I find I like to think and converse with my voice more than I do through writing specifically.
I'm curious in the future to try to write even more conversationally as a result. This post largely has a format of a blog post, but I am interested in what a non-linear conversation may look like too.

## Looking Forward

This was a super fun project for me and honestly made a big difference in my life.
During the time when I had the cast on it was truly invaluable. Before Footy was created, work was extremely annoying, if not painful. 
I didn't want to sit at my desk for more than an hour at a time, and it would give me a headache.

I also wrote my own custom speech-to-text application called Handy during this time, which I'll be sharing more about soon.
It's gonna be a fully open source desktop application.

I also want to do a larger reflection on using speech-to-text and voice with the computer generally so be on the lookout for that.
