Footy is a DIY foot pedal I made for use with speech to text apps while
I had my right hand in a cast with a broken finger. I would consider
this an assistive technology device, however I think it's a fun exploration
into alternative input devices as well. I think it's hilarious to 
use a computer with your feet. So I want to share with you the journey of 
how I made footy and how you can make one for yourself so you can
explore the world of the foot computing and experience alternative input
devices.

## Background

When I broke my finger it became very obvious I needed to be using
speech to text on a daily basis. Fortunately I have a ton of experience
with Whisper through writing Whisperfile, as well as running it on 
the [andromeda.computer](https://andromeda.computer) network
which powers [Geppetto](https://geppetto.app).

## Requirements

* USB-C Connector
* QMK Firmware
* Some RP2040 based microcontroller
* 3D Printed Case
* Cherry MX Switch
* Open Source Hardware/Software 
* Replicable for others

***MOST OF ALL IT HAS TO BE FUN***

## Prototype

The main components of the prototype I needed to decide on were the microcontroller
and the case. After a little bit of looking around I decided on the Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040
for the microcontroller as it was cheap, tiny, and had a built in USB-C connector. For the
case I browsed around for quite a while, and eventually found this Adafruit project 
for a foot pedal which I used as the base for my design.
