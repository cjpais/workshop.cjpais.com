I turned a 40 year old Apple Mouse into a speech to text button.

## Backstory

I had some plans to go to the [SoCal Vintage Computer]() Fair with my friend [Jordan](). At
the time I had a broken finger and had been working on the [footy](/projects/footy) foot pedal
and I had just finished the prototype. Going into the event I brought footy,
because I saw PCBway was a sponsor and I was interested in talking to someone there about
the possibility of making custom PCB design for footy. While I didn't end up making a custom
PCB for footy I definitely went into the event thinking about foot pedals and maybe some
vintage computer hardware that could be used for one.

Jordan and I walked around for a while [enjoying all that the fair had to offer](https://dumpster.page/vcf2025).
I learned a bunch about all kinds of hardware I had never seen before. On the first lap around
the fair I did take keen notice of the vintage Apple mice. I half joked with Jordan about turning
one into a foot pedal, and on the second lap I was seriously considering it. I even found one and
put it on the ground to test how it might be. Mostly just for the laughs, how hilarious to have
a mouse from the 80's as a speech to text foot pedal for my computer. And in trying it in some
ways it actually felt better as a foot pedal than footy.

After giving it a try I knew I wanted to buy at least one. Be it for a foot pedal, or just as
a really unique speech to text button for my computer. There was a guy early on who I bought
a couple of Byte magazines from, and he happened to have a few of these mice. I asked him if
he was willing to sell two of them, and he agreed, 2 for $40. Some other guy told me I was getting
a good deal, but honestly I had no idea if I had. It was only later I went on eBay to check, and
it seems like I did. I figured I wanted to get 2 of them mostly in the case I were to break one
which seemed highly likely given my dissasembly skills.

As soon as I got home, I wanted to open it up just to see what the insides looked like.
When I tried opening up the first one, I ended up breaking some of the clips because I didn't
go on YouTube and figure out how these things actually assembled and I just brute-forced it apart.
But I got to look at the insides and they looked something like this.

## Prototype Exploration

I had a bunch of initial thoughts. The first thing that I thought was that I could
just splice a USB-C connector onto the existing cable. This seemed like it could be a pain
for a few reasons but I really wanted to keep the original cable intact. It also wasn't clear to me
how I could splice on this connector and have it look original still.

The first few constraints emerged. First to be nondestructive to this Apple mouse. It should
be able to return to service after I have modified it for what I want. Second I wanted to
keep it looking as close to an original Apple Mouse as possible.

With these new constraints I had a few other ideas. The first was, I could try to reuse the
existing PCB and switch that's there, and just wire it to a new microcontroller.
The second thing I thought about was, well, I could 3D print a new baseplate where everything
would sit on top of, and I would have a lot more room to experiment with whatever I
want on the inside. This seemed a lot easier than both trying to keep the PCB intact
as well as somehow fitting whatever new microelectronics needed to go in it.
With this in mind I started to get to work on the first prototype.

## Building the First Prototype

Initially my plan was also to use USB-C, like footy, but I wanted a removable connection, not
a permanant one for whatever reason (now that I think of it, it would be rad to make
a new cable that looks original and just has a USB-C connector on the end).
Ultimately I tried this, but there wasn't enough space for a USB-C port on the front of the mouse.
Plus a wireless 1985 mouse is way cooler than a wired one.

So now everything was clear, my prototype would:

- Use Bluetooth to connect
- Not damage any of the original parts
- Look as close to original as possible
- Use a custom 3D printed baseplate

### Deciding on the Microcontroller

This was a fairly quick task. But the biggest thing I realized was that using QMK did not seem
as viable for Bluetooth keyboards. So I looked around and found ZMK which looked purpose built
for diy wireless keyboards/input devices. And reading through the docs it was clear I should
use some microcontroller based on the Nordic nRF52840. I did need it to be as small as possible
which kind of threw out the possibility of the common microcontrollers for ZMK like the Nice!Nano.
But I did have some experience with the Seeed Xiao series which are tiny, so I looked and they had
the Xiao-nRF52840, I figured this would be perfect.

### 3D Modeling

#### Baseplate

With the microcontroller decided upon, it made it possible for me to start designing the baseplate.
I measured the original M0100 PCB, as well as a bunch of the structures. Things like the screw holes,
the trackball hole, and most importantly the structure which holds up the button. With all the dimensions
I modeled the baseplate in Fusion 360.

Along the way I decided that the microcontroller shouldn't attach to the baseplate directly.
Instead it should sit vertically inside the mouse, so that the USB-C
port would be sticking out from the bottom of the mouse so it could be charged. I guess this is how
Apple must have decided on how to charge the Magic Mouse. Makes perfect sense now doesn't it.

I also would need a switch to attach to the baseplate, I wanted to try and use the same switch
as the original Apple Mouse, but the most available switch for the prototype was the Omron D2F-01F
which is commonly used in mice today. It also ended up being a more or less perfect fit for the baseplate
and just screw into it. Though it is much smaller than the original switch and definitely does not
have as satisfying of a 'click'.

I will say it took me forever to create nice enough structures for the mouse to work. I feel like
it's still not perfect, but it's good enough for me. I probably went through about 30 iterations
of the design to land where it is now. I think I have a lot more modeling experience from this
and it probably just needs a clean room design at this point.

#### USB-C Charging Plate

On the original mouse, there is this little twist off plate which holds the trackball in place.
This was exactly the area I wanted to put the microcontroller through, which meant I needed
to design a new plate so that the USB-C port for charging would be accessible. This was a pretty
fun thing to model, it needed to twist and lock into place, as well as have a tight fit for the microcontroller.
I measured Apple's original plate quite carefully and was quite proud that my first iteration of the
design printed and worked. I did make a few tweaks to the design, but overall it's almost exactly as
originally designed.

### Flashing the Firmware

### Soldering and Assembly - TODO

First thing's first, that is to solder everything to the Xiao. I typically start with the battery, and
I like to make everything removable which means soldering some JST leads onto the Xiao. I use the
positive pin on the battery section, and the ground on the board itself. Typically LiPO batteries have
a JST on them as well, so you can just plug whatever size battery you want in.

Next is soldering some leads to the switch.

With all the components acquired, the models 3D printed, and the microcontroller and switch soldered,
it was time to assemble the dang thing. First things first, always flash the firmware _BEFORE_
putting anything together. I developed a tiny piece of firmware based on ZMK which you can find
[here](https://github.com/cjpais/handy_m0100).

The assembly is quite simple, the first thing I like to do is take the switch and solder some
leads to the legs. From there I screw it directly into the baseplate using some M2x6mm screws?

After this I seat the baseplate in the mouse and screw it down using the screw which originally
held the PCB in place. From there I put in the microcontroller into the plate and push
the plate through.

## Using the Orignal PCB

After creating the first iteration of the mouse I decided that I really wanted to use the original
PCB. I kept clicking the OG switch and it was just so damn satisfying I had to try to use the PCB.
What's funny is after I figured out all of the stuff from the other version, this became a pretty
simple task. Just a matter of stuffing everything into the original spaces.

I had a few things that I thought were important. Similar to the other design I really didn't
want anything to be permanant, so all of the connectors had to be JST again, however with the
cramped spaces it really is best to use JST-ZH. That way they can fit through all the random
gaps here and there in the mouse.

The Xiao microcontroller fits within the area where the trackball would have been with no problem.
Plus I could use the same USB-C plate no problem. The only thing left is a place for the battery,
and I chose an 80mAh battery since I figured it would be very easy to find a place for it. And sure
enough on the corner of the mouse there's a space it fits quite nicely

Not to mention it's like actually genuinely useful and while I love my foot pedal partially because it's not wireless I can't travel very easily with it but I can totally throw this 1980s mouse in my backpack and carry it with me anywhere.

The battery life is surprisingly great as well. I do have deep sleep enabled, so the mouse will go to sleep and consume almost no power, and you just click the button and once to turn it back on.

## Feelings

I think there's also something very just aesthetically beautiful about the M0100.
It speaks to a simpler time, and I kind of hope that computers can be simpler again, in many ways.
I feel like the world has just made them so complex because the world is so complex. But sometimes you just need something simple.
Things that don't need to serve many purposes for millions of people, but things that serve the perfect purpose for a few.
I think that's in many ways what this project represents for me. It's certainly not something for everyone and that's
a wondeful thing. It suits me, and not gonna lie, having a 40 year old mouse and turning it into something still useful today is fucking rad as shit.

## Future?

This project has been a blast and I really love using a old Apple mouse with my modern computer.
There's something that feels right about it. I've never really tinkered with older hardware before
and I feel like this was maybe the easiest introduction I could have into that world.

One thing I would really love to do is make an actual PCB with a switch soldered on.
It would be really great to make some better structures to hold the button itself as well.
